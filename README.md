**READ Me (MIS):**

*Project Description:*

In this project, we developed a database system using SQL to manage student information for record-keeping purposes. We began by analyzing the MIS form, which collects comprehensive details about students, including personal information, academic history, and work experience. Using a bottom-up approach, we normalized the data into 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity. Based on the normalized tables, we created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visually represent the relationships between different entities in the database. Finally, we populated the tables with fictional data to demonstrate the functionality of the database.

*About the Form:*

The MIS form used in this project contains a wide range of student details that are crucial for administrative and academic purposes. The headers in the form include personal information like the student's name, contact details, and residential address, as well as academic details such as grades, educational qualifications, and specialization choices. Additionally, the form collects information about any prior work experience, certifications, and leadership positions held by the student. This form serves as a comprehensive tool to gather all relevant data about students, which is then organized and managed efficiently using the SQL database created in this project.
